# Chrome Extension - Outcognito

## Awards
Most Annoying Hack - Hack & Roll 2018

## What it does
Outcognito is quite frankly the opposite of incognito. It tweets out all of your activity, to make sure you escape no embarassment on your seemlessly benign browsing session (smirk).

## How I built it
With blood, sweat and plenty of tears. Just kidding. Over the last 24 hours, my team and I have built this chrome extension using nodejs, and a bit of client side HS script as well.
